# Client Implementation Complete

## What's Been Done

The client library for interacting with the Torus blockchain has been implemented with the following features:

1. **Network Support**: Added support for connecting to multiple networks:

   - Mainnet: `wss://api.torus.network`
   - Testnet: `wss://api.testnet.torus.network`
   - Development: `ws://localhost:9944`

2. **Metadata and Code Generation**:

   - Created a workflow for downloading blockchain metadata via the `get-metadata.sh` script
   - Implemented metadata generation using `subxt codegen` to create type-safe interfaces
   - Added support for network-specific interfaces via feature flags

3. **Network-Specific Features**:

   - Added `mainnet`, `testnet`, and `dev` features to conditionally include network-specific interfaces
   - Set up `just` commands for generating interfaces (`gen_interfaces`, `gen_for_live`)

4. **Helpful Utilities**:

   - Added utilities for working with metadata files
   - Implemented common operations like getting block information
   - Created example code showing how to use the client

5. **Developer Experience**:
   - Updated the flake.nix to include `subxt-cli` in the development shell
   - Added comprehensive documentation and examples
   - Implemented tests for verifying connectivity and functionality

## Usage Examples

```rust
// Connect to mainnet
let client = TorusClient::for_network(Network::Mainnet).await?;

// Get latest block information
let block_hash = client.latest_block_hash().await?;
let block_number = client.latest_block_number().await?;

// Access the API through generated interfaces
#[cfg(feature = "mainnet")]
{
    use crate::interfaces::mainnet::api;
    // Use generated types for type-safe interactions...
}
```

## Testing

The client can be tested using:

```bash
# Run tests for mainnet
cargo test -p torus-client --features mainnet test_mainnet -- --nocapture

# Run tests for testnet
cargo test -p torus-client --features testnet test_testnet -- --nocapture
```

## Next Steps

Potential enhancements for the future:

1. Add more helper methods for common operations
2. Implement transaction submission methods
3. Add more examples for different use cases
4. Consider adding a CLI interface for common operations
